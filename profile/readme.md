# Welcome to Team SURTES' Codespace
You'll find all of the code we're working on at the moment here in this organisation.

## Tech Stack
We run a JAMstack comprised of:
- [Directus](https://directus.io)
- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com)

## Contributing Guide
1. Clone the Directus repository.
2. Decrypt the `/secrets` folder with [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/vault_guide/index.html). Ask your committee or webmaster for a copy of the password.
3. Clone the Nuxt repository.

### Rules
- Create a new branch for any new changes
- Create merge requests and require another person's approval
